# Simple Clipboard Reader üìú

### **Project Description** üìú

This project demonstrates a simple C program that reads and displays the contents of the Windows clipboard.  While seemingly innocuous, this code highlights the basic mechanisms for clipboard access. It's useful for understanding how clipboard interaction works at a fundamental level, potentially as a building block for more complex applications.  However, it's crucial to understand that using this code without proper authorization or for malicious purposes is unethical and potentially illegal.

### **Installation Instructions** üíæ

1. **Compiler:** You need a C compiler that supports Windows API calls.  Microsoft Visual Studio (with the C++ desktop development workload) is a popular choice.  MinGW or Cygwin can also be used, but may require additional configuration.
2. **Code:** Download the provided C source code (`clipboard_reader.c`).
3. **Compilation:** Open a command prompt or terminal in the directory containing the source code. Compile the code using your compiler. For example, using Visual Studio's compiler (cl.exe):

   ```bash
   cl main.c
   ```

   This will generate an executable file (e.g., `clipboard_reader.exe`).


### **Features** ‚ú®

* Reads the contents of the Windows clipboard.
* Displays the clipboard contents as plain text to the console.
* Uses the Windows API for clipboard interaction.


### **Usage Instructions** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1. **Copy Text:** Copy some text to your Windows clipboard.
2. **Run Executable:** Run the compiled executable (`clipboard_reader.exe`).
3. **Output:** The program will print the copied text to the console.


### **Dependencies** üîß

* **Windows SDK:** The project relies on the Windows API, which is typically included with Visual Studio or available as a separate download.
* **C Compiler:** A C compiler is needed to build the project.


### **Commands** ‚öôÔ∏è

```bash
# Compilation (using Visual Studio's compiler)
cl main.c

# Execution
main.exe
```
